# Tips on CDs for Cars
*Sharpied on CDs are the greatest music aesthetic and if you disagree you are just wrong*

Sure, a lot of cars have aux inputs, or theres the option to change out head units so you can have apple carplay. But theres nothing like the sounds and feelings with choosing and putting in CDs. Trust me, save a couple hundred bucks holding off on the head unit and just use CDs, you'll love it if you get it right.

For whatever reason, there are a bunch of different disk types, but you'll need to get CD-R because anything else won't play properly and will skip around. (People say that some cars can handle CD-RW too, mines one of them and it flat out doesn't work.) 

Next, you'll have to make sure all of your songs are under 3 mins, and the whole playlist should be kept under 80min. Most CDs you can buy will have their limits written out on them (ex. 52 songs @ 3min/song for 80mins total.) In addition, a max writing speed will likely be advertised, but just ignore this and choose the slowest option so you know it'll work.

Also, disregard any apps or software that says it'll take a playlist and turn it into mp3s or CD-playable. Most just dont work and itunes and spotify have changed their legal and made it impossible to directly transfer to CDs anymore (at least as far as I know). 

Just have your playlist open in one tab on your computer, and youtube on the other. Search up the songs in youtube, take them to an [mp3 converter](https://320ytmp3.com/enFEwi/), then save them to a folder. If you want the songs to play in a certain order, rename their mp3 files in numerical order.

If you're on windows you'll want to open up media player once you've got all your files downloaded and named. Tab over to the burn option, and drag all your mp3s into the burn list. Don't stress over the order they download in, if you've numbered them thats how they'll play. Now toss in a CD (external disk readers are $20 ish if you don't have one), click on it when it comes up, and hit the big burn button.

Mac mfs will need to put the CD in first then drag the folder of songs over to the window that pops up, arrange your files (mac may or may not follow your numbered order, but this lets you keep the song names if your car can display them). Now pull the trigger to burn, and you should be good to go.

Orrrrrr, try and find pre-made CDs to use, because the guys that make those have actually good tech and it'll just work and run through your car perfectly, even if they bend the rules on the CDs. Theres still a place or two that sell CDs, try a London Drugs or Sunrise Records. Its way more fun to browse in person than to just order them online.

I like keeping some of the old stuff around with cars, gives them more flavour. So, if you do stuff like that i'd love to hear about it on IG [@uninsuredmotorist](https://www.instagram.com/uninsuredmotorist/)
